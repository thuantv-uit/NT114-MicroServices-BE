# Project: Web Management Application with Ollama

## Introduction
This project leverages Ollama, a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned from an existing model, to assist users in managing objects such as boards, columns, and cards in a web application. The application allows creating, editing, and deleting these objects through a user interface (frontend), business logic (Python backend), and the Ollama model for processing language-related queries.

The model has been trained with data related to web applications, providing guidance and support to users on how to use the application and optimize their workflow.

## Requirements
- Operating System: Linux, macOS, or Windows (with WSL for Windows).
- Ollama: Installed on the machine (see installation instructions at Ollamaâ€™s official site).
- Python: Version 3.8 or higher, with required libraries (see requirements.txt).
- Node.js (for frontend, if applicable): Version 16 or higher.
- Ollama Model: The fine-tuned model for the web application must be downloaded and configured.
- Environment: Ensure network connectivity to download the model initially (if needed).

## Usage Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

### Step 1: Stop Ollama on Desktop (if running)

### Step 2: Run Ollama as a Service

### Step 3: Run the Python Script for Logic Processing

### Step 4: Connect Frontend to Backend

### Step 5: Web Information Processing
